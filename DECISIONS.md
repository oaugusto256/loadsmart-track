# Decisions

## Why React?

It's the most used and loved Front-end library to create UIs nowadays. The state of JS 2018, shows that React has a live time span bigger than any other framework or library. Its documatation has an expressive amount of examples and explanation about how to use it, the community is really big and the more important its maintained directly by the Facebook team.

## Architecture

I have chosen to use the same architecture that React docs has as example. Because React is just a library, it doesnt have a static and immutable way to organize the project. It was a simple challenge example, so I didn't overthinking a lot about it.

## Tests

I was a little bit late to send the project, so unfortunelly I couldn't create some tests for the project. But, I really know that it is necessary and it is a must have at any real project.
